-----------Front End Excercise--------------

--->The framework structured as Page Object model as, we are storing page object in a class file and accessing those object in the test cases by creating the object of the class files.


To run need to have a chrome driver compatible to selenium 2.53 version(already present in the framework)
I have added the dependencies in the pom.xml file for testng 6.8 version and selenium 2.53 version.
To run system need to have Java 1.7 minimum.

The application build on a maven java project structure.
